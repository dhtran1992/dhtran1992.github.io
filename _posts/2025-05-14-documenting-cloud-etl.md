# Documenting Cloud-Based ETL Pipelines

## Introduction

Cloud-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines are an essential concept for modern, high throughput data needs. If done properly, these pipelines can be very performant, but the distributed nature of these systems can become challenging to understand for developers and users.

This article shares a practical example from documenting cloud-based ETL pipelines integrated with platforms like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, and Meta, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and usability.

## Understanding the Pipeline Architecture

The ETL pipeline consists of several components:

- **Optional: Ingestion:** An optional preprocessing step, that can validate and filter the data before it gets to the actual extraction.
- **Data Extraction:** Pulls data from multiple sources to hydrate the data, e.g., if there are required fields that need to be populated on a transaction
- **Transformation:** Recieves the hydrated data and transforms it, commonly mapping the data to the fields the destination api expects.
- **Loading:** Writes processed data to destination (CRM, data warehouse etc.) 

A typical architecture diagram helps visualize these components and their interactions (see Figure 1). Here's an example in LucidChart

## Creating Effective Documentation

### Use Clear, Consistent Terminology

Avoid jargon when possible and define all acronyms upfront. For example, use “Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)” on first mention, then “ETL” thereafter.

### Include Visual Aids

Diagrams, flowcharts, and tables can significantly improve comprehension. Use tools like draw.io or Lucidchart to create architecture diagrams and embed them within your documentation.

### Write Step-by-Step Procedures

For onboarding or troubleshooting, provide detailed step sequences with screenshots or code snippets. For instance, document how to monitor ETL job status in AWS CloudWatch or how to handle common errors. I love as many details as possible, but perhaps put them in an optional, but easily to access area, or hidden behind a collapsable section.

## Collaborating with Cross-Functional Teams

Effective documentation requires input from engineers, product managers, and customer support teams. Regular review cycles ensure content remains accurate and relevant.

## Conclusion

Well-structured documentation empowers users and reduces support requests by enabling self-service. By focusing on clarity, visuals, and collaboration, technical writers can turn complex ETL systems into accessible knowledge resources.
