# Finding My Rhythm: A Personal Journey Through Change and Creativity

*This is a reflection on the unexpected turns life takes—and how rediscovering creativity can light the way forward when everything else feels uncertain.*

You never know what life will throw your way. One thing is certain: it’ll never go exactly how you expect. It can be heavy, painful, and at some point, you might feel like giving up. That’s the price of being alive.

Ever since I was young, I was always singing—sitting in my grandma’s living room watching that Vietnamese karaoke VHS for the umpteenth time, singing my little head off. I’d go to school and hear the rhythmic tapping of pencils, the squeaking of shoes, or that abrupt crescendo of the electric pencil sharpener we finally got in second grade. Everything—from video games to gravel crunching beneath runners’ feet in the woods behind the high school—my mind always gravitated toward sound: the soundtracks, the voices, the rhythmic pulse of life. It’s a musician’s life for me! Or so I thought.

I went through my young adult years committed to music education. I wanted to be a college professor, to spread good music to kids and young adults. I wanted to use my bombastic, kind of annoying personality for the betterment of art in our species.

But then the realities of life hit. Mental health started to decline. The daily struggles took their toll, and I found myself floating between my third and fourth majors.

> *“What am I doing here?”* I asked myself, but the clock was ticking. More time in college meant more bills.

The next thing I knew, I was sitting in the back of a computer lab, clacking away on a keyboard, coding in Java. Computer Information Systems? Well, I’m a nerd who likes to stay at a desk, so… I guess that works! And so, five semesters later, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in CIS.

But I felt like I’d sprinted through too fast. I had no history of coding before that and was foggy on the basics, but somehow, I kept getting people to like me. Off to corporate America I went.

Then the music stopped.

The music stopped—not because I lost interest in programming or problem-solving, but because burnout and self-doubt began to overshadow the joy I once found in my work. There were days when coding felt like a grind, and imposter syndrome whispered doubts, but I kept pushing through. Over time, the routine became monotonous, and I realized I was missing a creative outlet—something to reignite my passion and purpose.

Fast forward years later—recently divorced, buying my own house with a big mortgage, swallowing a fistful of happy pills every morning to “fix my brain.” Even with relative success, things felt empty. The dreaded burnout, honestly already present for years, was surfacing.

And then it happened—when my time at GoFundMe ended, I felt lost, like my dreams were crushed. At least, that’s what I thought at the time. Now, I’m on a path of rediscovery. I was always scared to pivot, afraid of losing financial stability. But life gave me another chance to reflect and move forward toward where I’m truly meant to be. And I believe I’m finally on my way.

The music started to return. The clacking of keyboard keys wasn’t a miserable fugue but rather an inspiring fanfare. Keys dancing on the keyboard, searching for a new path.

> *“Why am I not panicking?”* I ask myself. But perhaps I was missing something—I was missing the creativity, the expression.

I was missing the music.

*Oh, where will it take me next?*
