# Why Developer Enablement Starts with Empathy

Coming into engineering from a nontraditional background, I kept asking myself: *Where’s the documentation?* Or worse, *why was it last updated in 2006?*

As a backend engineer building data pipelines and integrating with CRMs like Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, I saw the same pattern over and over. We prioritized infrastructure, performance, and deliverables—but the docs? They always got left behind. That really bothered me—a developer still finding his way, digging through whatever scraps I could find before messaging my lead for the seventh time that day.

We’d write documentation once—maybe during kickoff—but as requirements shifted, those docs quickly fell out of sync. Soon, they were useless. Eventually, no one trusted them, so no one updated them. The result? Confused teammates, frustrated customers, and endless repeat questions.

> This breakdown in documentation wasn’t just an annoyance—it created real friction for developers trying to get their work done. Without clear, trustworthy resources, teammates hesitated to adopt new tools or features. Instead of enabling productivity, our own work was slowing people down.

I noticed the same questions popping up repeatedly in Slack channels. It was frustrating for everyone—developers stuck searching for answers, leads overwhelmed by repeated queries, and product teams watching adoption stall despite valuable new features.

I spent years focused on correctness, performance, and scale—the core engineering challenges. But over time, I realized the tools themselves weren’t the problem. The real issue was communication. We were building tools and writing docs for ourselves—not for the developers and customers who actually needed them. We lacked empathy for the people reading our work—people like me.

That insight shifted how I thought about developer enablement. It’s not just about APIs or infrastructure. It’s about understanding the people who rely on our work—their needs, frustrations, and goals.

**Developer enablement starts with empathy.**

## Empathy Means Meeting Developers Where They Are

Empathy in developer enablement begins with a simple mindset shift:  
> **Assume the person reading your docs is smart, busy, and unfamiliar with your context.** They’re trying to solve a problem—not pass a test.

That means:

- Explaining the *why,* not just the *how.*
- Providing copy-paste-ready examples, not just method signatures.
- Anticipating edge cases, failure modes, and integration quirks.
- Writing like a human, not a spec generator.

Empathy also means designing docs and tools that work for people with different backgrounds, experiences, and learning styles. Inclusive documentation doesn’t just broaden reach—it builds trust across diverse developer communities.

These small acts of empathy compound over time. They save minutes in debugging, hours in support tickets, and weeks in trust-building.

## Documentation Is a Dialogue

Too often, documentation is treated as an afterthought—something you produce after the code is written. But great documentation is **a parallel conversation with your users**. It should evolve with their needs, reflect their language, and address their real-world use cases.

One of my most fulfilling projects involved documenting a cloud-based ETL pipeline for a donation platform. The technical challenge was interesting, but the real reward came when internal teams started saying things like:

> “Oh, now I finally understand how this all fits together.”

That’s developer enablement done right—when your docs become an extension of your support and product vision.

## Emotionally Intelligent APIs Start With Emotionally Intelligent Teams

I believe the best technical content isn’t just clear—it’s **considerate**. It treats the reader like a collaborator. It respects their time, their context, and their learning curve.

And in a world where AI is becoming a partner in how we build and learn, designing with empathy isn’t just good practice—it’s the foundation for building systems that understand and empower humans.

Beyond that, empathy makes the whole world better—one decision, one message, one moment of understanding at a time.
